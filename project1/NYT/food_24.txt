Jesse Schenker Is Closing Recette
Six years ago when the chef Jesse Schenker opened his tasting-menu restaurant Recette in a West Village shoe box, such places were not the rage they have become. Now he is closing Recette and carrying its approach to the Gander, the restaurant he opened two years ago in a larger space in the Flatiron district.
