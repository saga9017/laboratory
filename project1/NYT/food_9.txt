With Sugar on Top
Im not from Italy or Spain, where you can talk about the food for hours, Jasmina Bojic said, her cooks darting into the refrigerator beside her. Shes the executive pastry chef at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York, where she makes extravagant cakes fit for oligarchs, but, she said, my country is small. Its homey, nothing fancy about it, so Im nervous to tell you about our food. She was referring to Montenegro, a rough diamond set on the Adriatic, surrounded by Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo and Albania  more borders than I thought a country the size of Connecticut could have.
