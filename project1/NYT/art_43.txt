Nasher Sculpture Center Announces New $100,000 Prize
There is no shortage of prizes in the art world, but few specifically recognize sculpture. That will change, a bit, on Thursday with the announcement of the Nasher Prize, an honor that comes with a $100,000 award. The annual prize is intended to recognize a significant body of work that has had an extraordinary impact on the understanding of the art form, according to a news release.
