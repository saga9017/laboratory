Giants Who Play Well Together
Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea have experienced a lot of jazz history in parallel: as elite pianist-composers in post-bops twilight phase; as alumni of two successive Miles Davis quintets; as bandleaders who defined the arc of fusion; as artist-philosophers, National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters and perennial Grammy favorites. Theyre also a mutual admiration society, and companionable partners, as documented on a pair of sparkling albums: An Evening With Herbie Hancock & Chick Corea: In Concert (Columbia) and CoreaHancock (Polydor).
