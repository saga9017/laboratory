Classical Playlist: Stravinsky, Schumann and More
Jean-Efflam Bavouzet, pianist; Yan Pascal Tortelier, conductor; So Paulo Symphony Orchestra (Chandos CHSA 5147; one CD) Stravinsky wrote three ingeniously original works for piano and orchestra. Perhaps its because these pieces are so unconventional that they are seldom performed, a big loss for audiences. The excellent, inquisitive French pianist Jean-Efflam Bavouzet plays all three in bold, incisive performances on this new recording, with Yan Pascal Tortelier, another fine French artist, conducting the impressive So Paulo Symphony Orchestra. There is the flinty, Neo-Classical Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments; the inventive Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra, a beguilingly strange work drenched in Russian musical styles and colors; and the compact, amazing 12-tone Movements for Piano and Orchestra, heard today mostly at New York City Ballet as a score for a seminal George Balanchine ballet. This recording includes a vibrant account of Petrouchka (1957 version), with Mr. Bavouzet playing the formidable piano part. (Anthony Tommasini)
