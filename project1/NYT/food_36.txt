What To Cook This Week
Good morning, fellow travelers on the road to the delicious. It is the 115th day of this year, and the anniversary of the birth of the Cajun chef and storyteller Justin Wilson, who died in 2001. You may recall him for his catchphrase, "I gar-on-tee." Perhaps you could celebrate his legacy this evening with a big platter of Cajun broiled shrimp, along with a bowl of no-fuss grits and another of slow-cooked collard greens dressed in vinegar and red-pepper flakes? That would make a nice Sunday night meal.
