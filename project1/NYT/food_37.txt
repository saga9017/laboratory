Halvah Semifreddo With Hazelnuts
Aglaia Kremezi, a historian of Greek food who eschewed sesame desserts as a child, is now an enthusiast. In her own kitchen, she has rethought the traditional tahini filling for a Lenten cinnamon roll called tahinopita, and developed a super-easy recipe for halvah semifreddo, a frozen emulsion of fresh whipped cream and crystalline halvah. It is a spectacular dessert to serve at a dinner party, and the sesame undertones will surprise and delight guests.
