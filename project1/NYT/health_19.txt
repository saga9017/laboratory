Air Pollution Takes Early Toll on Children
Air pollution can be bad for children  starting even before birth, a new study suggests. Researchers studied exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, a form of pollution caused by burning gasoline, diesel fuel, home heating oil and coal. They found that prenatal exposure to these compounds was tied to changes in the structure of offsprings brains and to intellectual deficits and behavioral problems in childhood.
