Raise a Glass to Shakespeare
Drinkers probably love William Shakespeare more than Shakespeare loved drinkers. In college, I discovered the particular pleasure of exercising the liquor-loosened tongue on Shakespeare's glorious language, and reciting his sonnets was one of my favorite bar pastimes. No. 129 was always a hit, with its adjectival litany of nastiness: "murderous, bloody, full of blame/Savage, extreme, rude, cruel." April 23 marks the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, as good a reason as any to raise a glass ? even if he could be tough on drink: Drink, a porter tells Macduff in "Macbeth," "is a great provoker of three things ... nose-painting, sleep and urine."
