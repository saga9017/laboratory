Beer and Pasta From the Same Ingredients
Prima Pils, a new beer from Victory Brewing in Downingtown, Pa., welcomes spring with a light, bright, somewhat floral quaff. And the company has commissioned Vera Pasta of West Chester, Pa., to add elements of the brewing process that would have otherwise been waste  the malted barley and sweet wort  to make tightly twisted pasta. Instead of boiling the pasta in water, try cooking it as you would risotto, gradually stirring in well-flavored vegetable broth until the pasta is al dente, then folding in a generous handful of spring herbs with olive oil and cheese: Pasta Alla Prima, $5.50 for one pound, store.victorybeer.com; Prima Pils, $9.99 for a six-pack at Whole Foods and Fairway markets.
