Doctors Behaving Badly
What really goes on in an operating room? This week, the Annals of Internal Medicine published an anonymous essay recounting two appalling incidents that took place while gynecological patients were unconscious. The medical journal challenged doctors to call out colleagues who behave inappropriately, but so far the response has been polarizing. While some physicians and consumer advocates applauded the journal for shining a light on abhorrent behaviors, some doctors, mostly obstetrician-gynecologists who felt singled out by the essay, have criticized its publication, calling it inflammatory, unsubstantiated and sensationalistic.
