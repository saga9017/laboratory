The Best Comes in a Bun at Salvation Burger and Spotted Pig
April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman's newest restaurant, inside the Pod 51 Hotel on East 51st Street, is called Salvation Burger. I can't say that the first word of the name filled me with hope. The last time this chef and her business partner offered us salvation in a Pod hotel, they gave us Salvation Taco, a thronged taqueria designed for, and seemingly run by, people who don't know what a taco is.
