Health Agency Reports Lowest Weekly Total of New Ebola Cases
The World Health Organization on Wednesday reported the lowest weekly total of new Ebola cases so far this year in the three nations of West Africa that have been afflicted by the deadly virus. The organization said a total of 79 new cases were reported for the week that ended Sunday: 45 in Guinea, 33 in Sierra Leone and one in Liberia. The Liberian case in particular has raised concern because the country had reported no new Ebola cases for the previous three weeks, and the precise source of the new infection, in a 44-year-old woman from the Monrovia region, has not yet been determined. The latest weekly Ebola statistics showed that 10,311 people have died from the outbreak since it began last year.
