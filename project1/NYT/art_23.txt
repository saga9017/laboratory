Prince Knew What He Wanted: Sex, Soul and You
At work, propped against a wall, near piles of stuff, stands an Elvis Presley cutout. Its made of cardboard, pretty beat up, taller than I am and not the greatest photo. (He looks drunk. So does his lam suit.) But I pass that cutout almost every day, and every day I have the same thought. Elvis was hot. He was a musician, but he didnt have to be playing music for you to feel this way. Cardboard would do.
